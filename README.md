# product-expiry-tracker-app

# 100Devs 100Hours Project

The main purpose of the application is to prevent product westage through expiry.

# The application may best be used by people who live close to one another and may collect products whose expiry are due (especially food) and donate to places like children home where they can be used in bulk to prevent westage.

# The Application takes in products after a user buys from the store, where they key in profuct name, description, the dates of manufacture and expiry, and show the user how long they have till their product expires. Upon three days to expiry, the app should notify users that product expiry is soon and give options of places to make donations should they not be able to use it within that time to further minimize westage.

# Users can also make announcements by leaving comments on their products whose expiry are due or closer and may not use them for various reasons so that other users may take and use them

# Future Features

~ QR Code scanning of products
~ Notification of expiry without clicking on products to the user when expiry is a day to
